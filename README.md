# Regression Algorithms Implementation

This repository contains Python implementations of several popular regression algorithms. Regression analysis is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. These implementations cover various techniques including Simple Linear Regression, Multiple Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression, Random Forest Regression, Ridge Regression, and Lasso Regression.

## Algorithms Implemented

### 1. Simple Linear Regression
Simple Linear Regression is a linear regression model with a single independent variable.

### 2. Multiple Linear Regression
Multiple Linear Regression extends Simple Linear Regression to incorporate multiple independent variables.

### 3. Support Vector Regression (SVR)
Support Vector Regression is a type of support vector machine that performs regression tasks.

### 4. Random Forest Regression
Random Forest Regression is an ensemble learning method that constructs a multitude of decision trees during training and outputs the average prediction of the individual trees.

### 5. Ridge Regression
Ridge Regression is a regularized version of linear regression that adds a penalty term to the loss function, preventing overfitting.

### 6. Lasso Regression
Lasso Regression, similar to Ridge Regression, is a regularized linear regression method that also adds a penalty term to the loss function but uses the L1 norm penalty.

## Usage
Each algorithm implementation is provided in separate Python scripts. You can directly use these scripts in your projects or explore them to understand the algorithm implementations.

### Example Usage:
```python
# Importing Simple Linear Regression
from simple_linear_regression import SimpleLinearRegression

# Create a SimpleLinearRegression object
model = SimpleLinearRegression()

# Fit the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
